There once was a king
With a crown and a ring
Who sought new lands in spring 
Unaware of what war would bring
And so his armies took wing
To bring him one of everything

With Knight and Squire
With Sword and Fire
With rampant desire
His carnage rose higher
In circumstances dire
He built an empire

His knights all bled
His banners, shred
His sons were dead
His madness spread
Yet he never fled
And on his deathbed
No good was said
From upon his head
Fell a crown of dread

In a tomb he was lain
His work was in vain
For his empire and domain
Were sundered again
Nothing was to remain
But a smear and a stain
Of historic disdain
For all kings insane
And all egos inane
And so ended his reign
